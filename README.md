# Unlimited void

> Unlimited Void brings the user and their targets inside the Limitless itself, which is an endless void resembling outer space in appearance, with a large black hole, distant galaxies and numerous white patches in the background. Boundless raw information floods into the target's mind, overwhelming them to the point where they're completely immobilized.
> The complete incapacitation of the target is caused by a phenomenon where the target will be able to see and feel everything while not being able to see or feel anything at the same time. All the actions one has taken in their life is forced upon them infinitely and they can't do anything but die slowly. This effect does not affect the user or anyone they're touching, whether willingly or not, which can be exploited by an opponent to become immune to the domain expansion's effects.

#### A Super Exciting On-Chain Quiz App with real time questions are genrated by a model `domain_expansion` model using **Ollama** that keep track player high score.

- The web app is built using `ReactJS` and the frontend codebase is in `frontend` folder
- Smart Contracts are written in `cairo` and the blockchain codebase is in `smart contract` folder(Falied at compiling and deploying the contract)
- The backend is built using `node.js`, `express` and `mongoDB`
- The content is being genrated using a new model `domain_expansion` that is built using **Ollama** and is in `AI` folder
- User login is by using `Dynamic` Wallet

This is our first time in a blockchain hackathon and we tried our best!
Hope you enjoy playing it!
